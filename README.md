toDoh!
======

Really simple Android app using SQLite and a custom ListView.

Used to learn some aspects of Android programming:

  - ListView (Custom)
  - Notification
  - AlertDialog
  - Intent
  - SQLite

There is a lot of things to implement, correct and optmize !


Woah, sounds prety cool! How can i help make this "ToDo" app even better??
==========================================================================

Just follow this list of awesome things to upgrade on our software and we are ready to go !


What is missing
===============

  - Change BaseAdapter to a CursorAdapter
  - Edit entrys
  - Optional notification(on Add screen, put a checkbox "Notify?")
  - Timed notification (due date)
  - I think we should add some colors in the notes right?
  - Remove the Add/Clean button from menu and put it on the ActionBar (more intuitive)
  - Network
    - Login System ( Create User or Social Login )
    - Sync ToDoh's with "the cloud"
  - A really custom and minimalistc interface
